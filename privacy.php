By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, comments and other materials ("User Content"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly.<br> This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and <br>conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at http://instagram.com/legal/terms).
